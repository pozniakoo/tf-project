Project: Autoscaling 

In this project, I've configured autoscaling capabilities by harnessing CloudWatch scaling alarms, Auto Scaling Groups, and seamlessly integrating them with an Application Load Balancer. This setup ensures optimal resource utilization and enhances the scalability and reliability of the system.
