Project: Realistic CI/CD Pipeline 

This project focuses on the creation of a realistic CI/CD pipeline, meticulously designed to accommodate infrastructure segregation between Development and Production environments. By harnessing distinct branches within a repository for rigorous testing, the Production Pipeline is seamlessly activated upon the successful completion of these tests.
